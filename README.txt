Author informational page for Greg Rucka - one of my favorite authors. This is the start of what I would like to do with this. I want the design to be simple and have your eyes travel down the page to view his work. 

Trying to get the three lists at the bottom of the page to show as tghree columns. May not be able to do this but I guess I can keep trying. 

March 23rd Update - 
Was able to get the column layout working - testing in jsFiddle did the trick. Was also able to get the blockquote I wanted at the top of the site, the social media area completed, and the hover states for the links working. 

March 23rd Update 2 - Added in the active links, changed the link hover color, and made some other small edits.
